## 0.26.0

### Patch Changes

- 6795191: fix(edgeless): keep mobile canvas toolbars within the viewport

  On narrow (mobile) viewports two canvas toolbars overflowed off-screen,
  hiding actions:

  - The selected-element contextual toolbar grew to `max-content` with no
    upper bound. It is now capped to the available viewport width (floating-ui
    `size` middleware) and wraps to a second row instead of overflowing. (A
    scroll container was avoided on purpose: the "More" dropdown is a descendant
    of the toolbar, so `overflow` would clip it and make it unclickable.)
  - The senior framework slide-menu was sized to `max-width: calc(100vw - 16px)`
    but right-aligned to a center-ish toolbar button, so a near-full-width menu
    hung off the LEFT edge on mobile. It is now centered on the main toolbar and
    capped to 95% of the toolbar's width (the existing slide-menu scroll handles
    any remaining overflow), via a shared `clampSeniorMenuToToolbar` helper that
    replaces the duplicated inline positioning in all six framework senior
    buttons (Wardley, BPMN, Cynefin, EDGY, Mind Map, DDD). Desktop is unaffected
    since those menus are narrower than the cap.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- c775151: Update the Cynefin background to the latest Liminal Cynefin artwork: add the
  teal "iterate" liminal curve, the Probe/Sense/Respond decision text for each
  domain, the teal annotation labels (strategy by design, radical innovation,
  good/best practice, exaptation sub-labels) and the central Aporia (A) /
  Confusion (C) markers.

  The toolbar exposes independent toggles: "Show / hide titles" (domain names +
  the A/C marker glyphs and names), "Show / hide explanatory text" (subheadings,
  decisions, annotations, notes) and "Show / hide liminal line" (the teal curve).

- c775151: Update the Estuarine map background to the latest artwork (reference space
  690×801): darker magenta axes (#941253) with larger arrowheads, the Volatile
  boundary redrawn as an explicit curve (instead of a half-circle arc), refreshed
  Liminal / Counter-factual curves, and letter-spaced legends with their own
  colours (green LIMINAL, red VOLATILE, dark COUNTER FACTUAL, red italic e / t
  axis letters). The per-curve and axis-label toggles are unchanged.
- d2f435f: Turn the edgeless template panel into a per-framework catalog of worked-example
  diagrams and prefab components. Each framework package contributes its own
  category (Wardley, EDGY, Cynefin, Estuarine, BPMN) via a new
  `extendTemplateCategory` helper, and a generic "Other" category (SWOT, Kanban,
  Business Model Canvas, Fishbone, Gantt) ships from the template package. Every
  template is composed only from existing shapes — the framework's own prefab
  shapes first, general BlockSuite shapes second — so dragging a card inserts real,
  editable elements.

  The templates senior-toolbar button now renders last (new optional `order` on
  `SeniorTool`), and the playground's placeholder cat stickers are removed.
