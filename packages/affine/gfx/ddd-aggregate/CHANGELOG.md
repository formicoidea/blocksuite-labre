### Minor Changes

- 75770e1: feat(blocks): every seed the DDD frameworks, the generic diagrams and the gfx-primitive packages write into a document at creation now resolves through the translation seam (`translateKey`, ADR 0016), so a document created in a translated host starts in that language instead of English — a document created before these keys existed keeps its plain text.

  Event Storming's eight sticky captions and its hotspot; Core Domain's five sub-domain dots and three Team Topologies markers (both palettes derived from tables shared in `ddd-shared`, exported once as `dddSharedTranslationEntries` and spread into each consuming framework rather than restated); Context Map's bounded-context bubble and its cloud's "System" name; Cynefin/Estuarine's two hand-composed compositions ("Decision sorting"'s four domain stickies, "Constraint map"'s three hexagon captions); the standalone "Aggregate Design Canvas" template's header and nine section titles; the five generic ("Other") templates — SWOT's four quadrant labels, Kanban's card/column words, the Business Model Canvas's title and nine section names, Fishbone's category/effect/item words, Gantt's phase names and its `{{n}}`-parameterised week header; a frame's and a group's default title (`Frame {{n}}` / `Group {{n}}`); the "/ Mind Map" slash command's and the drag-from-basket mindmap tool's root and child captions; the four starter mindmap templates' root and three topic captions; and an imported `.mm`/`.opml` file's untitled-node fallback.

  Every hand-composed template touched (the mindmap starters, the two Cynefin/Estuarine compositions, the Aggregate Design Canvas, the five generic diagrams) gained a `localize` rebuild mirroring the derived-template mechanism already in place: without a host catalogue every one of them still inserts byte-identical English content. Non-framework packages that write seeds now have their own small `translations.ts`, listed under a new `PACKAGE_SEED_WORDINGS` table in the manifest (source `seed`, alongside the existing chrome-sourced `PACKAGE_WORDINGS`) — the same minimal extension the seed-source manifest already needed for a framework's own seeds.

  Left untouched, and why: the DDD Context Map's nine relationship patterns write no seed at all since WS2 (the palette arms the connector tool rather than dropping a labelled group — nothing to translate); the mindmap model's own "New node" default (a red zone — `packages/affine/model`) and the two callers that rely on it sit in packages outside this lot's scope; the code and shared-adapter "Plain Text"/"Untitled" fallbacks run in the paste/import pipeline's `Transformer`, whose optional `provider` is never wired to the editor's `TranslationProvider` by any existing caller.

- 6271b11: feat(blocks): the DDD frameworks' automatic legends, the surface/root editor chrome, the generic gfx tools (brush, connector, pointer, group, link, template) and a handful of shared services now resolve their strings through the translation seam instead of a baked-in English literal.

  Every DDD auto-legend's box title ("Legend") joins the shared `com.labre.board.legend.title` wording, and each framework's section titles (Context Map's "Boundaries"/"Relationships", Core Domain's "Sub-domains"/"Team interaction modes"/"Movement", Event Storming's "Stickies"/"Flow") get their own seed key via `AutoLegendSectionSpec.titleKey`. The Context Map relationship rows drop their pre-built `"PS — Partnership"` string in favor of `labelPrefix` + the role's own translated `labelKey`, resolved at legend-build time. The Aggregate Design Canvas template tab now carries a `TemplateCategory.nameKey` instead of a literal name.

  The edgeless block toolbar (turn-into menu, alignment menu, misc actions, the "More" submenu, zoom-to-selection and mindmap Tab/Enter shortcuts), the SVG importer's eighteen best-effort remarks (one key per sentence shape, `{{name}}`/`{{unit}}`/`{{kind}}` interpolated), the brush/eraser/pen tooltips, the connector toolbar (modes, styles, add-text) and quick-tool, the pointer hand/select tooltips, the group toolbar and its "Group {{n}}" seed, the link undo button, and the templates panel's search placeholder are all translated the same way — `translateKey(std, ...WORDING)` for chrome rendered with `std` in hand, a sibling `…Wording` field for static toolbar-action configs.

  Three importers (markdown, mix-text, plain-text `toDocSnapshot`) resolve their "Untitled" seed through a new shared `resolveWording(provider, wording)` helper (`@labre/affine-shared/adapters`, also now backing `ClipboardAdapter`'s size-limit toasts), since these transformers carry a `ServiceProvider` but no `std`. The doc-display-meta service's "Untitled"/"Deleted doc" fallbacks, the PNG export's untitled-doc filename, the comment toolbar button and the generic notification's "Undo" action follow the same pattern.

  `@labre/std`'s "Block Version Mismatched" card resolves its four wordings through a `TranslationProvider` looked up by NAME (`createIdentifier('AffineTranslationService')`) rather than by importing `@labre/affine-shared` — the dependency between the two packages runs the other way — proven by a new unit test that registers a fake provider under the same name from an independently-constructed identifier.

  With no host catalogue registered, every one of these surfaces renders exactly the English text it always has.

  Left as-is, and why: `MindmapElementModel.addNode`'s "New node" default is a model default (red zone) — the Tab/Enter call sites in `blocks/root` now pass the text explicitly instead, using a seed key declared in `blocks/root`'s own table since the mindmap framework's table does not carry it yet. `bracket-pairs.ts`'s pair names and the code-block language ids are internal matching keys, never displayed. The native `showOpenFilePicker` filter descriptions (`filesys.ts`) have no reasonable seam to a host catalogue from a plain module constant. `open-doc-config.ts`'s item labels are dead code today (only `.isAllowed` is read). The `senior-tool.ts` "Pen"/"Template" names are core tools with no framework descriptor, by the same design already documented for every other core tool.

### Patch Changes

- 26988c0: fix(blocks): the Aggregate Design Canvas template's translation keys no longer make `@labre/core` import the ddd-aggregate bundle. The package exports `dddAggregateTranslationEntries` from its root, like a framework bundle exports its `…TranslationEntries`; a bundled host composes them with core's manifest when it installs `@formicoidea/labre-framework-ddd-aggregate`. The monorepo manifest is unchanged.

## 0.39.0

### Patch Changes

- 8f7a4f2: fix(edgeless): the Templates panel lists exactly the categories of the frameworks registered on its editor, without a reload (#244)

  A framework's category was appended to a module-level registry from
  `effect()` and never removed, so a host that re-mounted the editor with a
  framework switched off kept seeing its category until a full page reload.
  Categories are now registered in the editor's DI container
  (`TemplateCategoryExtension`, from the flag-gated view extension's `setup()`)
  and the panel reads them from the `std` of the edgeless it opens on. The
  remembered category tab falls back to the first one when it no longer exists.

  API: `extendTemplateCategory` is removed; register
  `TemplateCategoryExtension(category)` from `setup()` instead.
  `EdgelessTemplatePanel.templates.extend(manager)` (the global host hook) is
  unchanged, and `templateManagerFor(std)` exposes the per-editor catalogue.

## 0.38.1

### Patch Changes

- f0e3906: fix(edgeless): each DDD framework registers its own templates category

  The Event Storming, Core Domain Chart and Context Map template categories are
  now registered by the framework that owns them, under that framework's flag,
  like every other framework's. The aggregate bundle registers the Aggregate
  Design Canvas only: it used to import the three sibling framework bundles to
  register all four, a dependency the published bundle layout does not allow,
  and the 0.38.0 publish stopped on it.

## 0.38.0

### Patch Changes

- 5bf6a03: feat(edgeless): DDD palette templates are derived from the creation commands

  The Event Storming, Core Domain Chart and Context Map sections of the Templates
  panel were hand-written surface JSON, last touched in June 2026 while the three
  toolboxes kept moving — so what the panel dropped had stopped being what the
  buttons draw. A sticky arrived as one flat rectangle instead of the shadow and
  face a post-it is made of, without the text fit that keeps the handwriting
  inside the square; not one of the thirty-one templates carried a semantic role,
  which is what the validation engine, the automatic legend and "Change type" all
  read, so an Event Storming board built from the panel was mute to all three; the
  Core Domain chart was not recognised as a chart; the sub-domain dots came
  without their name, and the markers without their letter.

  Every one of them is now DERIVED: the template is produced by running the
  command itself against a recording surface, so it cannot disagree with the
  toolbox, and each package's parity test re-runs its commands and compares. The
  Event Storming board and the Context Map board join the panel, which never had
  them.

  Ten entries are removed rather than repaired: the nine Context Map relationship
  patterns and Core Domain's "Movement over time". Those buttons stopped dropping
  a drawing some time ago — a relation and a movement are statements you draw
  between two real artefacts, and the palette was still shipping the mid-air
  version they replaced. Draw them from the sub-menu instead, where the endpoints
  attach.

  The Aggregate Design Canvas stays hand-composed (no command draws it) and its
  title bar, until now dark on dark, is legible again.
