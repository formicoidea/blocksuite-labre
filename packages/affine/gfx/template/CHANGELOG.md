### Patch Changes

- f1a4af7: Twenty-six strings a French host still read in English now go through the
  translation seam: the colour picker's Heavy row, the slash menu's List and
  Style headers, the five "Other" template tiles, the embed error card's
  sentence, the SVG import's three refusals, the two "Untitled" linked-doc
  titles, and the accessible name of every toolbar menu (which used to read
  "changer le type de forme-menu"). New keys, English fallbacks letter for
  letter what shipped — a host with no catalogue sees no change.

  New keys: `com.labre.palette-name.heavy-{red,orange,yellow,green,blue,purple,magenta}`,
  `com.labre.slash-menu.group.list`,
  `com.labre.template.name.{swot,kanban-board,business-model-canvas,fishbone,gantt-chart}`,

### Minor Changes

- 6cfe313: feat(blocks): the translation seam takes interpolation parameters and the host's locale. `TranslationService.t(key, params?)` and `translateKey(std, key, fallback, params?)` carry the values of a sentence with holes in it; fallbacks use i18next placeholders (`{{name}}`), and the library fills them itself when the host has no entry. `hostLocale(std)` gives the host's full language tag for `Intl` formatting. Each package now declares its own wordings, which the key manifest collects. The slash menu resolves `nameWording`, `descriptionWording`, `captionWording` and its group headers against the host's catalogue, and search matches both the translated and the English name. Templates rebuild the text they write into the document in the inserting editor's language (`Template.localize`). With no `TranslationProvider` registered, nothing changes on screen. A host adapter should forward `params`: `t: (key, params) => i18n.exists(key, params) ? i18n.t(key, params) : undefined`.
- 5776733: feat(blocks): route bypassed i18n keys through the seam instead of raw literals. The DDD/EDGY/C4 auto-legends (`createAutoLegend`) now resolve every row's label and a section's own title through the role/preset key it always carried, wherever a host registers a catalogue — the Context Map "Relationships" row, the Core Domain "Sub-domains" row, the Event Storming "Stickies" row and EDGY's facet section titles (three new keys, `com.labre.edgy.legend.facet.*`) all reached this by accident before. The templates panel resolves a command-derived template's tile tooltip through the command's own `labelKey` (`resolveTemplateName`), a category's tab label through its own key (`com.labre.framework.<id>`, new `TemplateCategory.nameKey`), the "Add" hover caption through a new `com.labre.template.panel.add` key, and search now matches a translated name as well as the English one. The connector's "Reverse direction" tooltip and the edgeless embed toolbar's "Card view" / "Embed view" switcher now resolve through the same keys their page-mode counterparts already used, instead of restating the words. `UniverseTagDefs` (`TagDef` / `TagValueDef`) gains an optional `labelKey` beside `label` — backward compatible, a host pack needs no change — and the library's own Wardley-natures / Porter-competition pack uses it; every renderer of a tag label (the "Qualify" toolbar, the reading panel) resolves it. New manifest source `'tag'`. None of this changes what a catalogue-less playground shows: every fallback is the exact English text already on screen.
- 75770e1: feat(blocks): every seed the DDD frameworks, the generic diagrams and the gfx-primitive packages write into a document at creation now resolves through the translation seam (`translateKey`, ADR 0016), so a document created in a translated host starts in that language instead of English — a document created before these keys existed keeps its plain text.

  Event Storming's eight sticky captions and its hotspot; Core Domain's five sub-domain dots and three Team Topologies markers (both palettes derived from tables shared in `ddd-shared`, exported once as `dddSharedTranslationEntries` and spread into each consuming framework rather than restated); Context Map's bounded-context bubble and its cloud's "System" name; Cynefin/Estuarine's two hand-composed compositions ("Decision sorting"'s four domain stickies, "Constraint map"'s three hexagon captions); the standalone "Aggregate Design Canvas" template's header and nine section titles; the five generic ("Other") templates — SWOT's four quadrant labels, Kanban's card/column words, the Business Model Canvas's title and nine section names, Fishbone's category/effect/item words, Gantt's phase names and its `{{n}}`-parameterised week header; a frame's and a group's default title (`Frame {{n}}` / `Group {{n}}`); the "/ Mind Map" slash command's and the drag-from-basket mindmap tool's root and child captions; the four starter mindmap templates' root and three topic captions; and an imported `.mm`/`.opml` file's untitled-node fallback.

  Every hand-composed template touched (the mindmap starters, the two Cynefin/Estuarine compositions, the Aggregate Design Canvas, the five generic diagrams) gained a `localize` rebuild mirroring the derived-template mechanism already in place: without a host catalogue every one of them still inserts byte-identical English content. Non-framework packages that write seeds now have their own small `translations.ts`, listed under a new `PACKAGE_SEED_WORDINGS` table in the manifest (source `seed`, alongside the existing chrome-sourced `PACKAGE_WORDINGS`) — the same minimal extension the seed-source manifest already needed for a framework's own seeds.

  Left untouched, and why: the DDD Context Map's nine relationship patterns write no seed at all since WS2 (the palette arms the connector tool rather than dropping a labelled group — nothing to translate); the mindmap model's own "New node" default (a red zone — `packages/affine/model`) and the two callers that rely on it sit in packages outside this lot's scope; the code and shared-adapter "Plain Text"/"Untitled" fallbacks run in the paste/import pipeline's `Transformer`, whose optional `provider` is never wired to the editor's `TranslationProvider` by any existing caller.

- 6271b11: feat(blocks): the DDD frameworks' automatic legends, the surface/root editor chrome, the generic gfx tools (brush, connector, pointer, group, link, template) and a handful of shared services now resolve their strings through the translation seam instead of a baked-in English literal.

  Every DDD auto-legend's box title ("Legend") joins the shared `com.labre.board.legend.title` wording, and each framework's section titles (Context Map's "Boundaries"/"Relationships", Core Domain's "Sub-domains"/"Team interaction modes"/"Movement", Event Storming's "Stickies"/"Flow") get their own seed key via `AutoLegendSectionSpec.titleKey`. The Context Map relationship rows drop their pre-built `"PS — Partnership"` string in favor of `labelPrefix` + the role's own translated `labelKey`, resolved at legend-build time. The Aggregate Design Canvas template tab now carries a `TemplateCategory.nameKey` instead of a literal name.

  The edgeless block toolbar (turn-into menu, alignment menu, misc actions, the "More" submenu, zoom-to-selection and mindmap Tab/Enter shortcuts), the SVG importer's eighteen best-effort remarks (one key per sentence shape, `{{name}}`/`{{unit}}`/`{{kind}}` interpolated), the brush/eraser/pen tooltips, the connector toolbar (modes, styles, add-text) and quick-tool, the pointer hand/select tooltips, the group toolbar and its "Group {{n}}" seed, the link undo button, and the templates panel's search placeholder are all translated the same way — `translateKey(std, ...WORDING)` for chrome rendered with `std` in hand, a sibling `…Wording` field for static toolbar-action configs.

  Three importers (markdown, mix-text, plain-text `toDocSnapshot`) resolve their "Untitled" seed through a new shared `resolveWording(provider, wording)` helper (`@labre/affine-shared/adapters`, also now backing `ClipboardAdapter`'s size-limit toasts), since these transformers carry a `ServiceProvider` but no `std`. The doc-display-meta service's "Untitled"/"Deleted doc" fallbacks, the PNG export's untitled-doc filename, the comment toolbar button and the generic notification's "Undo" action follow the same pattern.

  `@labre/std`'s "Block Version Mismatched" card resolves its four wordings through a `TranslationProvider` looked up by NAME (`createIdentifier('AffineTranslationService')`) rather than by importing `@labre/affine-shared` — the dependency between the two packages runs the other way — proven by a new unit test that registers a fake provider under the same name from an independently-constructed identifier.

  With no host catalogue registered, every one of these surfaces renders exactly the English text it always has.

  Left as-is, and why: `MindmapElementModel.addNode`'s "New node" default is a model default (red zone) — the Tab/Enter call sites in `blocks/root` now pass the text explicitly instead, using a seed key declared in `blocks/root`'s own table since the mindmap framework's table does not carry it yet. `bracket-pairs.ts`'s pair names and the code-block language ids are internal matching keys, never displayed. The native `showOpenFilePicker` filter descriptions (`filesys.ts`) have no reasonable seam to a host catalogue from a plain module constant. `open-doc-config.ts`'s item labels are dead code today (only `.isAllowed` is read). The `senior-tool.ts` "Pen"/"Template" names are core tools with no framework descriptor, by the same design already documented for every other core tool.

- 223b280: feat(blocks): close three shared translation seams the earlier i18n lots flagged as missing, then translate every string that was waiting on them. `Template.nameKey` gives a hand-composed template (a worked scene, an example map) a tile name of its own -- `resolveTemplateName` checks it before the `commandId`-derived path -- and every BPMN, Wardley, EDGY, Cynefin, Estuarine and mind-map hand-authored card now carries one. `AutoLegendSpec.titleKey` (already resolved by `createAutoLegend`) is now set for EDGY and C4's own "Legend" boxes, so both translate through the shared `BOARD_LEGEND_TITLE` key exactly like the three DDD boards already did. `MorphSpec.afterMorph` takes an optional 4th `std` parameter, which the morph toolbar now passes through: morphing an untouched TRANSLATED placeholder rewrites it to the target kind's own translated placeholder (`c4MorphedTypeLine`, `wardleyMorphedLabel`), where it used to fall back to English. Beyond the three seams: the note tool's overlay caption and a document's "Untitled" fallback (`inlines/reference`, the linked-doc HTML/Markdown exporters) now resolve through the shared `BLOCK_NAME_TEXT` / `DOC_UNTITLED` wordings instead of a raw literal; the "Template" senior-tool button gained a `labelKey`. Per a PO decision (2026-09-12), the linked-doc import dialog's English fallback now says "Labre" instead of the inherited "AFFiNE" in the two sentences that named it. Every addition is optional and retro-compatible: with no `TranslationProvider` registered, nothing on screen changes.

### Patch Changes

- b2781b5: refactor(blocks): one chrome word, one key. Where several packages declared the same English interface word under different keys (Copy-style verbs, text formats, display modes, Reload, Rename, Settings…), they now share one wording from `@labre/affine-shared/services`, and the key manifest carries 52 fewer entries. Nothing changes on screen, and no key that existed in a previous release is removed: the merged keys were all introduced by this release's translation work. The manifest spec now fails when a new interface word is declared under a second key (real homonyms such as « Light » or « Left » are allow-listed with a reason).

### Minor Changes

- 95ff0a5: feat(edgeless): every framework notation now shares one neutral scale, `NOTATION_NEUTRALS` (`@labre/affine-shared/consts`), taken from the Wardley map: ink, frame ink, label grey, divider, card, card border and legend border. Board strips (BPMN participant band, C4 title band) are plain white. Framework hues and stencil-prescribed neutrals (C4 `#444444`, the EDGY base-shape ink `#262626`, Cynefin/Estuarine official inks) are unchanged. Board backgrounds repaint with the scale. Colours already stored on user elements are left untouched, and only newly created elements take the new defaults.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f7a4f2: fix(edgeless): the Templates panel lists exactly the categories of the frameworks registered on its editor, without a reload (#244)

  A framework's category was appended to a module-level registry from
  `effect()` and never removed, so a host that re-mounted the editor with a
  framework switched off kept seeing its category until a full page reload.
  Categories are now registered in the editor's DI container
  (`TemplateCategoryExtension`, from the flag-gated view extension's `setup()`)
  and the panel reads them from the `std` of the edgeless it opens on. The
  remembered category tab falls back to the first one when it no longer exists.

  API: `extendTemplateCategory` is removed; register
  `TemplateCategoryExtension(category)` from `setup()` instead.
  `EdgelessTemplatePanel.templates.extend(manager)` (the global host hook) is
  unchanged, and `templateManagerFor(std)` exposes the per-editor catalogue.

### Minor Changes

- 13d17cf: feat(edgeless): Wardley palette templates are derived from the creation commands

  A template of the senior menu's Templates panel used to be a hand-written copy
  of what the toolbox creates, and every copy had drifted: no template grouped a
  node with its name (the toolbox has since #51), the four map backgrounds
  carried no `wardley:map` role and stayed resizable, the inertia bar lost its
  text-fit mode, and five artefacts (Porter's forces, accelerator, decelerator,
  the two areas) had no template at all.

  `@labre/affine-gfx-template` gains `snapshotFromAction` / `templateFromCommand`:
  a template is now produced by running the command itself against a recording
  surface, so it cannot disagree with the toolbox. Snapshots carry an explicit
  z-order for every element, and a template may declare `afterInsert` for a depth
  that depends on what is already on the board (a Wardley area lands under the
  components it covers, above the map). The two shipped maps (Tea Shop, Kodak
  inertia) are rebuilt on the same presets, with every node grouped with its
  label. A parity test guards both directions: every artefact command has its
  template, every template matches its command.

  Inserting a template (or pasting) that holds a group inside a group could
  shuffle the paint order: the z-order sort looked one level of grouping up only,
  which made its comparison cyclic. It now orders by the whole group chain, the
  same order the canvas paints in.

### Patch Changes

- 1b59f3c: A closed popup stops following its anchor

  Menus, sub-menus and the edgeless template panel are kept glued to the element
  that opened them by a floating-ui positioning loop. That loop installs scroll
  and resize listeners on every ancestor plus a resize observer, and it hands
  back a function that removes them again. Three of them threw that function
  away: the loop kept measuring a popup that had already been removed, and its
  listeners kept the popup, its anchor and everything they closed over alive.
  Opening and closing a context menu or the template panel repeatedly therefore
  grew memory and slowly made scrolling heavier.

  Each of the three now stops its loop: a sub-menu when its owning item is
  removed even though the sub-menu is still open, a popup when it closes, and the
  template panel both when it closes and when the toolbar button goes away.
  Positioning while a popup is open is unchanged.

## 0.24.0

### Patch Changes

- bc31490: feat(edgeless): split the "Others" toolbox into a dedicated Mind Map button

  The combined senior button now splits in two:

  - **Mind Map** — a dedicated senior button (the mindmap glyph, the `m` shortcut,
    the style picker + import), flag-gated by `mindmap`.
  - **Others** — keeps free-text and add-file, flag-gated by a new `other` flag
    (it no longer rides the `mindmap` flag), same basket icon minus the mindmap.

  Both buttons share one parameterized component/menu (`variant`). Mindmap
  rendering (element view, painter, interaction, contextual toolbars) is now
  always registered, independent of either flag — so disabling a button never
  un-paints existing mindmaps nor breaks Templates-panel insertion.

  A new **"Mind Map"** section in the Templates panel offers the 4 built-in styles
  as starter mindmaps. Inserting a mindmap template required teaching the
  template id-regeneration middleware (`replaceIdMiddleware`) to remap a mindmap's
  node-id references (`children` keys + `parent` back-refs), so inserted mindmaps
  rebuild correctly.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- d2f435f: Turn the edgeless template panel into a per-framework catalog of worked-example
  diagrams and prefab components. Each framework package contributes its own
  category (Wardley, EDGY, Cynefin, Estuarine, BPMN) via a new
  `extendTemplateCategory` helper, and a generic "Other" category (SWOT, Kanban,
  Business Model Canvas, Fishbone, Gantt) ships from the template package. Every
  template is composed only from existing shapes — the framework's own prefab
  shapes first, general BlockSuite shapes second — so dragging a card inserts real,
  editable elements.

  The templates senior-toolbar button now renders last (new optional `order` on
  `SeniorTool`), and the playground's placeholder cat stickers are removed.
