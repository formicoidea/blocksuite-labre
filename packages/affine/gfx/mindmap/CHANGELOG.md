### Patch Changes

- 6795191: fix(edgeless): keep mobile canvas toolbars within the viewport

  On narrow (mobile) viewports two canvas toolbars overflowed off-screen,
  hiding actions:

  - The selected-element contextual toolbar grew to `max-content` with no
    upper bound. It is now capped to the available viewport width (floating-ui
    `size` middleware) and wraps to a second row instead of overflowing. (A
    scroll container was avoided on purpose: the "More" dropdown is a descendant
    of the toolbar, so `overflow` would clip it and make it unclickable.)
  - The senior framework slide-menu was sized to `max-width: calc(100vw - 16px)`
    but right-aligned to a center-ish toolbar button, so a near-full-width menu
    hung off the LEFT edge on mobile. It is now centered on the main toolbar and
    capped to 95% of the toolbar's width (the existing slide-menu scroll handles
    any remaining overflow), via a shared `clampSeniorMenuToToolbar` helper that
    replaces the duplicated inline positioning in all six framework senior
    buttons (Wardley, BPMN, Cynefin, EDGY, Mind Map, DDD). Desktop is unaffected
    since those menus are narrower than the cap.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- bc31490: feat(edgeless): split the "Others" toolbox into a dedicated Mind Map button

  The combined senior button now splits in two:

  - **Mind Map** — a dedicated senior button (the mindmap glyph, the `m` shortcut,
    the style picker + import), flag-gated by `mindmap`.
  - **Others** — keeps free-text and add-file, flag-gated by a new `other` flag
    (it no longer rides the `mindmap` flag), same basket icon minus the mindmap.

  Both buttons share one parameterized component/menu (`variant`). Mindmap
  rendering (element view, painter, interaction, contextual toolbars) is now
  always registered, independent of either flag — so disabling a button never
  un-paints existing mindmaps nor breaks Templates-panel insertion.

  A new **"Mind Map"** section in the Templates panel offers the 4 built-in styles
  as starter mindmaps. Inserting a mindmap template required teaching the
  template id-regeneration middleware (`replaceIdMiddleware`) to remap a mindmap's
  node-id references (`children` keys + `parent` back-refs), so inserted mindmaps
  rebuild correctly.

### Patch Changes

- bc31490: fix(edgeless): keep senior-button sub-menus anchored to their button

  Two senior-button sub-menus positioned themselves against the whole toolbar
  instead of their own button, so they drifted once senior buttons can be hidden
  at runtime:

  - **Wardley map** right-aligned to the rightmost senior-tool slot (via a layout
    scan), which moves when buttons are toggled off.
  - **Others** (the mindmap basket) had no `position: relative` on its host, so
    the popup's clip wrapper anchored to the toolbar and left-aligned there.

  Both now right-align to their own button edge like every framework senior button
  (Cynefin, EDGY, BPMN, DDD), which stays correct whatever buttons are hidden.
