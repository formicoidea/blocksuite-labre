### Minor Changes

- 1efc6d5: feat(edgeless): an element can say what KIND of thing it is (MF3)

  Implements ADR 0007: the level-3 contextual qualification of a surface element,
  the format its definitions take, and the one-way reflection of a bound
  occurrence's qualification onto its pivot record (ADR 0006 § 4).

  Level 2 said what an element IS on a map (`role`, PR #71). Level 3 says what
  kind of thing it is — a Wardley component is an activity, or data, or a
  practice, or knowledge — and that is a different question, authored on the
  element, reflected onto the record, and read by the rules engine.

  - **`tags?: Y.Map<string[]>` on `GfxPrimitiveElementModel`**, keyed by
    namespaced tag def id. A NESTED Y.Map and not a plain object, because
    `@field()` writes straight into the element's Y.Map with no `native2Y` in the
    path: a plain object there is ONE opaque value, so two people qualifying the
    same element on two DIFFERENT tags would silently lose one of the two. The
    nested map merges per tag; the `string[]` of a single tag stays
    last-write-wins, which is correct — one tag's value set is one atomic choice.
    There is no migration runner for surface elements, so the shape is chosen
    once, and an under-powered merge is the harm class the red zone exists to
    prevent.
  - **Default `undefined`, never stamped.** Declared on the BASE class so paste,
    duplicate and alt-drag clone preserve it for every primitive type at once,
    and absent by default so an element that is never qualified stays
    byte-identical to one created before the field existed: no schema version
    bump, no migration. Removing the last tag removes the key rather than leaving
    an empty map behind.
  - **`UniverseTagDefs` + `UniverseTagDefsExtension`**, the tags-only DI registry.
    Variant-parameterized on `packId` with `di.override`, so distinct packs
    accumulate and identical packs REPLACE: a host that re-registers on every
    render never throws and never grows the registry. The merge is total and
    silent — an invalid id, a cross-framework id, an unknown `formatVersion` each
    drop the offending def and record an issue. Nothing throws, ever: a
    misconfigured pack must never cost a user their board.
  - **The Wardley natures** (activity / data / practice / knowledge) ship as the
    library's one real pack, on the same mechanism a host uses for its own
    taxonomy. A client's private extension is a second pack with another
    `packId`, with no library release.
  - **`tag.set`**, a keyless `core` command taking the tag id and its values
    (`[]` clears). Read-only gated in `when` AND in `run`, `captureSync()` BEFORE
    the write, one `FrameworkElementPromoted` per gesture on the `tag` rung. Like
    `pivot.bind` it is self-emitting, and enumerated as such in the registry
    invariants test.
  - **A "Nature" section on the element toolbar**, generic in shape (it names no
    framework and builds from the seeded packs) and parameterized by the
    registrar's `RoleDefs`. It resolves through a canvas group to its single
    role-bearing member, so one click on a Wardley component reaches it.
  - **`PivotMaterialityPublisher`**, the local-gated watcher that reflects a bound
    element's qualification onto its record. Driven by Yjs transactions rather
    than by the setter or the command layer, because undo goes through neither: a
    setter-driven design desyncs the record on the very first Ctrl+Z. Coalesces
    per element per microtask, publishes full state, de-duplicates, and RETRACTS
    (`present: false`) on deletion, unbind and re-bind, so a record never keeps
    materialities attributed to an occurrence that no longer exists.

  **Release ordering, adopted from #67 recommendation #4 and unchanged from
  #89.** This release DECLARES the field; nothing in the product writes it until
  the host wires a qualification surface. Ship the declaration release before any
  release that writes `tags`, so the fleet floor tolerates the key.

  An older client keeps the value through load / edit / save (`syncElementFromY`
  mirrors every entry into `_preserved`), and — unlike `pivotDocId` — it keeps it
  on the five element-creation-from-props paths too, **as a plain object**: an
  undeclared key goes down the unknown-key branch, whose encodability guard
  accepts the serialized nested map because it is flat JSON. Nothing is lost; the
  shape is simply not the specified one. This release therefore also READS that
  degraded shape and CONVERTS it, preserving its content, on the first write —
  without which the declaring release would answer `{}` for a qualified element
  and then overwrite a colleague's tag, which would empty the release-ordering
  rule of its meaning.

  Two supporting changes in `@labre/std`, both consequences of the field being a
  nested Y type on the base class:

  - `syncElementFromY` re-attaches an `@observe`d nested type when the key itself
    is rewritten. Remote peers and undo/redo never reach the accessor's setter,
    the only other caller of `startObserve`, so the observer was left on a dead
    type and every later in-place mutation went unseen.
  - `startObserve` no longer warns for an ABSENT optional Y-type field. An
    unqualified element is the normal case, not a misuse.
