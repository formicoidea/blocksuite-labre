### Patch Changes

- ad21e60: fix(edgeless): the slide-out menu wears the toolbar's own corner radius

  The popup that slides out above the edgeless toolbar (the senior sub-menus,
  the shape menu — everything rendered through `edgeless-slide-menu`) rounded
  its top corners at 8px while the toolbar it sits on rounds at 16px, so the
  two read as different chrome. The popup now uses the toolbar's 16px radius;
  its bottom edge stays square, as before, where it merges into the bar.

### Patch Changes

- 8b00f7d: fix(blocks): core toasts, board tooltips, catalogue headers and seed texts cross the translation seam

  A host that wires `TranslationExtension` now gets a catalogue that covers the
  editor, instead of one that covers everything except the parts a user actually
  reads first. Six families of hard-coded English are gone (refs #182, #183);
  every one of them is a `com.labre.*` key with the previous literal as its
  English fallback, so an editor with no `TranslationProvider` registered reads
  exactly what it read before.

  - **Toasts** — "Copied to clipboard", "Linked doc created", "Note removed from
    Page Mode", "Frame inserted into Page.", "No link found".
  - **Board toolbars** — the resize toggle every framework board carries, and the
    two legend wordings, declared once in `@labre/affine-shared` rather than
    eight times.
  - **Editor chrome** — the toolbar verbs (Copy, Duplicate, Delete, Lock, Link,
    More, Bring to Front, Send to Back, Create linked doc, Draw connector), the
    view switcher (Switch / Inline / Card / Embed view) and the linked-doc card's
    four "nothing to show" sentences. `ToolbarAction` gained `labelWording` /
    `tooltipWording`: a declared `[key, English]` pair the toolbar resolves when
    it builds the row, which keeps a call site one line and keeps the row's width
    planning honest about what it is about to say.
  - **Catalogue headers** — every framework now contributes its own
    `com.labre.catalogue.category.*` keys. Core's registry names no framework
    category once `build:bundles` has stripped it, so a bundled host was drawing
    translated entries under English headers.
  - **BPMN import remarks** — the three whose wording is a fixed sentence carry a
    key (`InterchangeNote.messageKey`). The ones that name an element, an id or a
    count of lanes do not: the seam has no interpolation.
  - **Seed texts** — the caption a placed BPMN or EDGY artefact is given, and a
    C4 board's name, are resolved AT PLACEMENT. What lands in the document is
    content the author owns from that moment on and is never re-translated.

  `getTranslationKeyManifest()` gains all of it, including a new `'seed'` source
  for the words a framework writes onto the canvas.

  Three surfaces are deliberately left English, and each one is a refusal rather
  than an oversight. The **C4 component tier seeds** (`NODE_LABEL`,
  `C4_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER`, `DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER`) are read back as SENTINELS by
  the morph and by the mermaid exporter, which is a pure function of the board
  and has no `std` to re-resolve them with — translating them would change what
  an export writes. The **code block's "⋮"** is a `MenuItemGroup` rendered over a
  generic context that carries no `std`. The **slash menu** and the **mobile
  keyboard toolbar** item names are their own vocabularies, untouched apart from
  the toasts they raise.

### Patch Changes

- a9eb4f6: Senior buttons name themselves in the user's language

  The edgeless toolbar's senior-tool tooltips were the last piece of chrome that
  could only say "Wardley map" or "Event Storming" — a raw English string carried
  on the tool itself, invisible to the host catalogue. A senior tool can now
  declare `labelKey` alongside its `name`, and the toolbar resolves it through
  the same `TranslationProvider` seam every other library wording already uses.

  The seven frameworks declare the key their descriptor already publishes
  (`com.labre.framework.<id>`), so a host that built its catalogue from
  `getTranslationKeyManifest()` translates the buttons with no new key to add.
  `name` stays required and stays the fallback: it is what a standalone
  playground shows, and it is all the core tools (note, shape, template…) have —
  they own no framework identity, so they declare no key.

- e42e0c0: feat(std): the senior menu caps at fourteen and ranks seven past it

  A framework's senior button opens one row of buttons, and that row holds
  **fourteen**. Until now that number was a design review: the registry test
  refused a framework that _declared_ more than fourteen sub-menu commands, and
  nothing said what a framework should do once its toolbox honestly outgrew them.
  It now has an answer.

  Below the cap nothing changes at all — the sub-menu is the framework's authored
  list, whole and in the order its author wrote it. Past it, the row becomes a
  **shortcut to the seven artefacts this user actually reaches for**: the four
  most-used plus the three most-recent, deduplicated, with a command that tops
  both axes taking one slot and handing the freed one back to frequency. Two axes
  rather than one, because frequency alone never surfaces the tool picked up
  yesterday and recency alone would reshuffle the row at every click.

  The seven are then laid out **in authored order, never in rank order**. What the
  ranking decides is membership; position stays where the framework put it,
  because a menu whose buttons swap places under the cursor is precisely the
  pattern this feature exists to avoid. On a fresh install, with nothing measured
  yet, both axes collapse to authored order and the row shows the first seven — a
  cold start that is deterministic rather than empty.

  The ranking reads the framework's **whole catalogue**, not the fourteen its
  author picked. An artefact left out of the row that a user invokes constantly
  has earned a slot, and a selection that could only ever demote would never learn
  that.

  Beside the seven sits a permanent **More artefacts…** button, opening the
  catalogue sidepanel on the framework's full toolbox — and it appears only when
  something answers the new `ArtefactCatalogueProvider` seam, since a button that
  opens nothing is a dead control. The seam ships here as an interface; the panel
  behind it arrives in its own release.

  **Nothing visible changes today.** The largest framework in the library declares
  thirteen artefacts, so no senior menu is past the cap and every one of them
  still shows its whole toolbox. This is the rule the BPMN full pack will be the
  first to meet.

  > **Superseded later in this same release** — "The senior sub-menu seats
  > thirteen". The PO re-arbitrated on 28/08/2026: the row seats **thirteen**
  > (seven most-recent + six most-used), and the ranking reads the framework's
  > **nominated `senior-menu` list** rather than its whole catalogue. The cap of
  > fourteen, the author-order position law and the deterministic cold start below
  > are unchanged.

- 256ee0b: feat(edgeless): the artefact catalogue sidepanel

  A framework's senior sub-menu is a row of icons, and a row of icons stops
  working somewhere around fourteen. The catalogue is where the rest go: a
  full-height column down the left edge of the editor, listing everything the
  framework declares on the `'catalogue'` surface — grouped by the categories the
  framework itself declared, each artefact spelled out with its icon, its
  translated label and its keyboard chord instead of guessed from a glyph.

  It is drawn from the command registry and nothing else, so a framework that
  adds an artefact gets a row for it with no code written here. Rows are at least
  44px tall because these boards are worked on a tablet as often as on a laptop;
  the list scrolls, the canvas behind it does not. One tap runs the command and
  puts the panel away — and X, Escape and a click on the canvas all close it on
  the first gesture, none of them touching the tool the user had armed.

  `ArtefactCatalogueProvider` is the seam. The library registers its own panel as
  the default implementation, unconditionally; a host that already owns a sidebar
  registers `ArtefactCatalogueExtension(service)` and takes the catalogue over,
  after which the library's widget is never asked to open.

  Dormant until something opens it: no framework overflows its sub-menu yet, so
  today nothing calls `open` — the panel is there for the BPMN pack and for the
  hosts that want the catalogue on their own terms.

- 48c3b52: The catalogue leads with what you reach for

  The sidepanel now opens on a "Recent & frequent" head section (PO recette,
  27/08/2026): the same seven-slot arbitration the senior sub-menu runs,
  re-consumed through the new pure `rankCommandsByUsage` — one ranking, two
  consumers, never two opinions. (Later in this same release the two axes swap
  priority to recency-first, and the sub-menu grows to thirteen slots while this
  section stays at seven — see "The senior sub-menu seats thirteen".)
  Only commands that actually carry a measure appear, so a fresh install shows
  no section rather than a "recent" label padded with the never-used; the rows
  repeat below in their categories, the way every launcher does it.

- 6a20738: The catalogue scrolls under the wheel, stays open while furnishing, and can be switched off

  Three PO-recette corrections (27/08/2026). A wheel over the sidepanel now
  scrolls the artefact list instead of panning the board behind it — the same
  capture-phase fix the violation bubble earned in PR #103, scoped to the
  panel's own box so the canvas beside it keeps panning. Inserting an artefact
  no longer closes the panel: furnishing a diagram is several artefacts in a
  row, and the exits (close button, Escape, click-away) are all still one
  gesture. And `ArtefactCatalogueExtension(null)` is now the documented
  cold-assembly switch-off: the provider answers nothing, the "More artefacts"
  button is not rendered, the library panel never opens.

- f09f9a3: The senior sub-menu seats thirteen — seven recent, six most-used — and only
  commands that belong there

  Two PO rulings of 28/08/2026 on a framework's senior sub-menu past the cap.
  Both **supersede the arbitration recorded on 26/08/2026** ("the senior menu caps
  at fourteen and ranks seven past it", earlier in this release): that entry's cap
  of fourteen, author-order position law and deterministic cold start all stand —
  its slot count, its 4 + 3 split and its "rank the whole catalogue" rule do not.

  **Only its declarers are eligible.** The ranking used to read the whole
  catalogue, so a command that deliberately declines the sub-menu could be dragged
  into it by its own usage: the PO met "Export BPMN" in a row of things you DRAW
  and rightly asked what it was supposed to export. Membership is now drawn from
  the `senior-menu` surface alone — a declined surface is a statement about where
  a command belongs, not a default usage may out-vote. The overflow trigger still
  reads the catalogue, and the sidepanel's "Recent & frequent" head section still
  ranks it too: that panel is where every command of a framework is reachable, so
  a board action really does belong at its head.

  **Thirteen slots instead of seven, recency first.** Seven buttons in a
  fourteen-wide row left it half-empty; thirteen plus the permanent "More
  artefacts…" button is exactly the cap. The split is inverted to seven
  most-recent plus six most-used, because what you reached for this morning is
  what you are still working on. A command that tops both axes takes a recent
  slot, freeing its most-used slot for the next workhorse down. Display order
  remains author order — the ranking decides membership, never position — and a
  cold start still opens on the authored head, now thirteen deep.

  **The sidepanel's head section stays at seven.** Both PO rulings are about the
  sub-menu, and thirteen is argued from its geometry: a horizontal row of icon
  buttons where thirteen plus "More artefacts…" makes the fourteen cap. None of
  that transfers to a vertical list of 44px rows in a 320px panel, where thirteen
  would fill a laptop's first screen with duplicated shortcuts and push every
  category below the fold. The two surfaces share the arbitration and not its
  magnitude: the head keeps its own split (four recent + three used), so both
  halves of a section labelled "Recent & frequent" survive.

### Patch Changes

- 3639562: feat(edgeless): the direction of a typed edge is a statement, and W4 reads it

  `docs/adr/0010` in one slice. For a connector carrying an edge role, the
  persisted `source → target` pair IS the relation's orientation and part of the
  document's meaning. That was already true of the data since #71 — and it was
  invisible: the Wardley link tool draws no arrowhead, nothing said which way to
  drag, nothing showed which way it came out, and nothing could change it. A rule
  on top of that would have been a rule on top of an accident, so the three
  mechanisms that turn the by-product into a statement ship WITH the rule, never
  before it.

  - **M1 — say it.** An edge role now declares its own `direction`: the verb the
    relation is read with (`depends on`), and the sentence that tells the user
    which way to draw it. The Wardley link tool shows it under its label in the
    senior sub-menu ("Drag from the component that has the need to what it
    needs"), and the evolution arrow shows its own. Keys and framework fallbacks,
    resolved through the host's catalogue: the library still puts no words in a
    framework's mouth. `CommandDescriptor.descriptionFallback` is new, beside the
    `descriptionKey` that already crossed the manifest seam and was never
    rendered.
  - **M2 — show it.** Hovering or selecting a typed edge reveals a chevron at its
    TARGET end plus the role's verb — an `Overlay` and a widget
    (`affine-edge-direction-widget`), never the element renderer, which knows
    neither hover nor selection. At rest the map keeps its canonical arrowless
    look: on a Wardley map a permanent head already means evolution movement, and
    two meanings on one glyph make both unreadable. Nothing is revealed for an
    edge bound to nothing — a stroke that relates nothing says nothing.
  - **M3 — let them fix it.** `edge.invert-direction` swaps `source` ↔ `target`
    AND the two endpoint styles, in one undo step, from the contextual toolbar,
    the palette, Settings › Shortcuts or the agent. `curveControlPoint` is
    deliberately untouched (an absolute pass-through point at t = 0.5, symmetric
    under a `P0` ↔ `P3` exchange, so the drawn curve does not move — an
    integration spec pins it). It writes through the surface and not through
    `EdgelessCRUDIdentifier`, so an inversion never becomes the default style of
    the next connector drawn.
  - **`b.flip-direction` is hidden for a typed edge.** It swaps the arrowhead
    STYLES without touching the ends: honest on a generalist connector, a lie on
    an edge whose direction is the relation. Reverse direction takes its place.
    Gated on the ROLE vocabulary, not on a framework flag — a stored typed edge
    stays protected on a board whose framework tooling is switched off.
  - **W4, a new rule family — `relative-order-along-axis`.** Given a typed edge,
    the two elements it links are compared along one declared axis of the frame,
    in the order the edge states. Wardley ships
    `wardley.provider-above-consumer`: "a provider may not sit above its
    consumer", `warning` under strict, `audit` under sketch, with 2% of the map's
    height of slack (a ratio, never model units — two components drawn level are
    not a mistake). Its finding names THREE elements for the first time: the two
    nodes and the edge, because reversing the edge is one of the two honest ways
    out and that gesture lives on the edge. It stays silent on an edge with a
    free end, a dangling end, a pair straddling two maps, a self-loop, and any
    edge whose role is not the one it names. Cost is linear in the RELATIONS
    somebody drew — a 200-node chain is 199 findings, not 19 900 comparisons —
    and measures ~0.3 ms on the 500-element reference map.
  - **The role VOCABULARY is now registered** (`RoleVocabularyExtension`, from a
    framework's always-on render extension) and readable
    (`findRoleDef`, `isTypedEdgeRole`). The library had the "is this a typed
    edge?" predicate since PF1 and used it nowhere.
  - **Templates.** The palette's "Link" and "Evolution arrow" swatches are
    de-typed: a horizontal stroke bound to nothing is a sample of a style, and it
    must claim nothing. Both template kits now decide what a stroke MEANS with
    one flag (`evolution`) instead of two different colour tests — a style
    inconsistency until W4 read these edges, a semantic one afterwards. Kodak's
    red _solid_ links stay typed dependencies, which is what they are.
  - **Telemetry.** `EdgeDirectionInverted` (ids only, never board content): how
    often a direction has to be corrected is the measurement of whether the
    drawing gesture announces itself well enough.
  - The inversion acts on the typed edges of the selection, so a lasso holding a
    Wardley link and a plain connector reverses the first and leaves the second
    alone — rather than showing no direction entry at all. A typed edge with a
    free end offers none: there is no relation there to reverse.
  - `VERDICT_PROPS` gains `source` and `target`, so re-pointing or reversing an
    edge re-judges the board instead of waiting for an unrelated drag.

## 0.23.0

### Patch Changes

- d2f435f: Turn the edgeless template panel into a per-framework catalog of worked-example
  diagrams and prefab components. Each framework package contributes its own
  category (Wardley, EDGY, Cynefin, Estuarine, BPMN) via a new
  `extendTemplateCategory` helper, and a generic "Other" category (SWOT, Kanban,
  Business Model Canvas, Fishbone, Gantt) ships from the template package. Every
  template is composed only from existing shapes — the framework's own prefab
  shapes first, general BlockSuite shapes second — so dragging a card inserts real,
  editable elements.

  The templates senior-toolbar button now renders last (new optional `order` on
  `SeniorTool`), and the playground's placeholder cat stickers are removed.
