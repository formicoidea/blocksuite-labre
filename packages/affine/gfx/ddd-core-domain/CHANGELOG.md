### Minor Changes

- 881d3f5: feat(blocks): every framework bundle publishes a data-only ./commands-manifest subpath, and bundle .d.ts stop leaking \_pkgs internals

  ## `./commands-manifest` (#181)

  A host settings pane that lists the framework commands — id, label, chord,
  scope, owner — had one published route to them: the bundle's MAIN entry. A
  `CommandDescriptor` carries its `run`, so that entry pulls the framework's whole
  action graph behind it: the import/export machinery (Wardley's `import.js` alone
  is 47 KB), the surface, gfx, model and shared deep paths of core. Nothing can be
  tree-shaken away, because every descriptor genuinely references its handler. The
  pane's chunk was carrying eight action graphs to draw about a hundred static
  rows.

  Each framework bundle now also publishes `./commands-manifest`, modelled on the
  existing `./descriptor`: the same commands projected to the six fields a
  shortcuts panel needs — `id`, `owner`, `labelKey`, `labelFallback`, `scope`,
  `defaultKeys` — with no `run`, no `params`, and type-only imports, so the module
  references nothing at all. It is a few hundred bytes per framework instead of
  megabytes.

  The projection is `toShortcutManifestEntry`, new in `@labre/std` beside the two
  projections that were already there. `scripts/build-bundles.mjs` refuses to
  build a framework whose manifest module reaches for a runtime import, and a unit
  test pins every manifest row-for-row against the commands it projects, so the
  second copy cannot drift from the first.

  ## `labelFallback` survives the projection (#181)

  `getShortcutManifest`'s row type kept `labelKey` but dropped `labelFallback`,
  which left a host with no translation catalogue rendering raw i18n keys — and
  forced every host to re-project from the main entry to recover a wording the
  library already knew. `ShortcutManifestEntry` now carries it, and it is declared
  once, in `@labre/std`, so core's rows and a framework bundle's rows are the same
  type: a host concatenates them. `owner` also narrows from `string` to
  `CommandOwner`, and the never-populated `when?: string` is gone.

  ## `_pkgs/*` in the emitted declarations (#60)

  The published `.d.ts` named internal core subpaths — `_pkgs/global/utils`,
  `_pkgs/global/di`, `_pkgs/affine-widget-edgeless-toolbar` — that core's
  `exports` map did not carry. tsc synthesises them when emitting a dependent
  bundle's declarations, by reverse-mapping the tsconfig `paths` entry onto the
  file a type physically lives in. Only `skipLibCheck: true` hid it; a consumer
  that type-checks the bundle declarations got unresolved-module errors.

  `scripts/compile-bundles.mjs` now scans the finished emit for those references
  and publishes exactly the subpaths it finds, then re-checks every reference
  against the map it wrote. Rewriting the specifiers to a public shim was the
  alternative and was not taken: a rewrite only has a target when a public shim
  happens to re-export that exact module, and nothing guarantees one exists for
  every internal declaration tsc may name. Publishing the subpath always has a
  target, and deriving the list from the emit keeps the exposure to what the
  declarations genuinely need.

### Patch Changes

- 8b00f7d: fix(blocks): core toasts, board tooltips, catalogue headers and seed texts cross the translation seam

  A host that wires `TranslationExtension` now gets a catalogue that covers the
  editor, instead of one that covers everything except the parts a user actually
  reads first. Six families of hard-coded English are gone (refs #182, #183);
  every one of them is a `com.labre.*` key with the previous literal as its
  English fallback, so an editor with no `TranslationProvider` registered reads
  exactly what it read before.

  - **Toasts** — "Copied to clipboard", "Linked doc created", "Note removed from
    Page Mode", "Frame inserted into Page.", "No link found".
  - **Board toolbars** — the resize toggle every framework board carries, and the
    two legend wordings, declared once in `@labre/affine-shared` rather than
    eight times.
  - **Editor chrome** — the toolbar verbs (Copy, Duplicate, Delete, Lock, Link,
    More, Bring to Front, Send to Back, Create linked doc, Draw connector), the
    view switcher (Switch / Inline / Card / Embed view) and the linked-doc card's
    four "nothing to show" sentences. `ToolbarAction` gained `labelWording` /
    `tooltipWording`: a declared `[key, English]` pair the toolbar resolves when
    it builds the row, which keeps a call site one line and keeps the row's width
    planning honest about what it is about to say.
  - **Catalogue headers** — every framework now contributes its own
    `com.labre.catalogue.category.*` keys. Core's registry names no framework
    category once `build:bundles` has stripped it, so a bundled host was drawing
    translated entries under English headers.
  - **BPMN import remarks** — the three whose wording is a fixed sentence carry a
    key (`InterchangeNote.messageKey`). The ones that name an element, an id or a
    count of lanes do not: the seam has no interpolation.
  - **Seed texts** — the caption a placed BPMN or EDGY artefact is given, and a
    C4 board's name, are resolved AT PLACEMENT. What lands in the document is
    content the author owns from that moment on and is never re-translated.

  `getTranslationKeyManifest()` gains all of it, including a new `'seed'` source
  for the words a framework writes onto the canvas.

  Three surfaces are deliberately left English, and each one is a refusal rather
  than an oversight. The **C4 component tier seeds** (`NODE_LABEL`,
  `C4_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER`, `DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER`) are read back as SENTINELS by
  the morph and by the mermaid exporter, which is a pure function of the board
  and has no `std` to re-resolve them with — translating them would change what
  an export writes. The **code block's "⋮"** is a `MenuItemGroup` rendered over a
  generic context that carries no `std`. The **slash menu** and the **mobile
  keyboard toolbar** item names are their own vocabularies, untouched apart from
  the toasts they raise.

### Minor Changes

- 7136db0: A Core Domain Chart is checked, and its movements are drawn as statements

  Selecting a chart now offers Validation — Sketch (the default, where every
  finding is silent and reaches a report rather than the canvas) or Strict — and
  Work quality, three expectations to tick: the chart has a legend, movements are
  dated and justified, the core has been agreed by the team.

  Four checks ship with it. An outsourced sub-domain plotted in the Core quadrant
  is a strategy contradiction and says so; a movement that does not run from a
  current position to a future one — drawn backwards, or looping onto its own
  start — is reported with both ends named; two sub-domains drawn on top of each
  other are flagged as unreadable; and a dot recoloured off the five legend
  colours is recorded as an audit finding, never as a badge. Everything else stays
  silent: a free connector, a movement onto a big bet or onto a plain shape, a dot
  on blank canvas, and any artefact drawn before today, which carries no semantic
  role and is never judged. No document is migrated and no chart is backfilled.

  "Movement over time" is now a drag rather than an arrow dropped on the canvas:
  picking it arms the connector tool, pre-styled dashed red, and you draw from
  where the context stands today to where it is heading — which is what makes the
  direction a statement the chart can read back. Arrows drawn before this change
  keep working as drawings.

  The chart's own drawing is now declared rather than coded: the same bands, the
  same axes, the same words, to the unit. The declaration also carries a second
  reading of the frame — a migration chart naming its four quadrants low-hanging
  fruit, risk-seeking, risk-averse and last toothpaste — which no rule cites and
  which has no switch in the interface yet.

- cbd9471: feat(edgeless): the three DDD boards generate the legend of what is drawn on them

  Select a **Context Map board**, an **Event Storming board** or a **Core Domain
  Chart** and its toolbar now offers a legend button. Pressing it reads what is
  actually inside the background's perimeter and drops a legend of exactly that,
  bottom-left of the board — the same gesture a Wardley map has had for a while,
  and the same result: a real, editable, movable group of elements, not an overlay.
  A board with three sticky kinds on it gets a three-row legend; add a fourth kind
  and press the button again for a legend that mentions it.

  What each board lists:

  - **Context Map** — the bounded context, and one row per relationship pattern
    drawn, with its DDD Crew abbreviation and its own line style (dashed for
    Separate Ways and Big Ball of Mud, exactly as the board draws them);
  - **Event Storming** — one row per sticky kind stuck to the board, in its own
    colour, hotspot included, plus a Flow row once an arc has been drawn;
  - **Core Domain Chart** — one row per sub-domain kind placed, in its own colour,
    one row per Team Topologies marker used, square and letter included, plus the
    red dashed Movement over time.

  The legend reads the artefacts' **semantic roles**, not their shapes and not
  their fill colours. That is what makes it agree with the validation rules — both
  read the same field — and it is what keeps a restyled sticky in the legend and an
  orange rectangle somebody drew to think with out of it.

  One consequence on the Core Domain Chart, whose legend button already existed and
  used to scan fill colours: a chart the tool recognises nothing on — every chart
  drawn before roles existed — now yields a framed, titled legend with no rows
  instead of the whole notation; a legend lists what is drawn, not what could have
  been. The five sub-domain colours it does list are the same five the palette
  draws with, by construction, and so are the three marker colours.

  Reading by role is also what finally lets the chart list its **Team Topologies
  markers** honestly. Collaboration, X-as-a-Service and Facilitating are now
  artefacts the tool recognises rather than three coloured squares, so a chart with
  a marker on it gets a "Team interaction modes" section naming the ones actually
  used — with the same letter in the same coloured square the chart draws — and a
  chart with none is not told about modes it did not use. Being recognised costs
  them nothing else: a marker is an annotation, not a sub-domain, so the overlap
  and legend-colour checks written on sub-domains still leave it alone, including
  when it is parked right against the dot it comments on.

  Every legend box is now titled **"Legend"**. The three DDD tools shipped with a
  French title on an otherwise English notation; the boxes are elements written
  into the document, so existing ones keep whatever title they were drawn with.

  The **Context Map palette keeps its own Legend entry**, which still lays out the
  full notation, cloud included. The two gestures answer two
  different questions — "what does this notation mean" and "what did we actually
  draw here" — so that module deliberately has both. The cloud is the one artefact
  the automatic legend cannot mention: it carries no role, on purpose, because a
  relationship drawn onto one is a sketch the tool stays silent about.

  Every legend button is available with its framework's button switched off: a
  legend is elements written into the document, not tooling.

### Patch Changes

- 1dbd735: Framework flows keep their style to themselves

  Arming a typed flow tool — a BPMN sequence flow, message flow or association, a
  Wardley link or change arrow, an EDGY relation, a Context Map pattern, an Event
  Storming flow, a Core Domain movement, a C4 relationship — used to write the
  flow's look into the shared "last used connector style". The next plain
  connector then came out dressed as that flow (dash, colour, arrowheads) while
  carrying none of its meaning; BPMN 2.0 (p.40) explicitly forbids other
  connectors adopting a flow's line style.

  The framework look now rides on the tool activation itself
  (`ConnectorToolOptions.style`) and is applied to the drawn edge at creation
  only. The last-props store is never touched by a framework activation, so the
  plain connector tool keeps drawing with the user's own last style — which
  still persists exactly as before when set from the plain tool itself.

- 2ec39c0: validation rules carry their provenance — standard, recommendation or Labre convention — and the violation bubble says so

  A rule now declares where its authority comes from, as data rather than as prose
  buried in its message: `standard` with the page of the specification it reads,
  `recommendation` for a SHOULD or an industry linter's rule, `labre-convention`
  for a house style of this editor and nothing else. The violation bubble shows it
  as one discreet line under the finding, with the rule's own citation printed
  verbatim — so a convention can never reach an architect dressed as a norm
  violation, which is what an external review of the BPMN integration asked for.

  The field is purely descriptive: no evaluator reads it, and a rule that declares
  one raises exactly the findings it raised before.

  All twenty-two BPMN rules declare it — twelve `standard`, each with its page,
  eight `recommendation` naming a linter or the sentence the standard merely
  permits, and two conventions that say so out loud. The self-loop check left
  `bpmn.sequence-flow-endpoints` and became `bpmn.sequence-flow-self-loop`: the
  endpoints matrix is BPMN 2.0.2 p.95 and the no-self-loop habit is ours, so one
  rule could not have declared either honestly. Same wording, same severity, same
  i18n keys, one new rule id in the profiles.

  That new id is the one thing this change does not carry over: user exceptions
  are persisted per rule id, so an exception granted on a self-looping flow under
  `bpmn.sequence-flow-endpoints` no longer matches and the finding returns. No
  migration ships, because BPMN landed days ago and these packages are
  unpublished, so the set of affected documents is empty — but the same rename
  after publication would need a migration or an alias, and should not lean on
  this precedent.

  The other five frameworks' rules are annotated too — mostly `recommendation`
  naming the method, with the readability nudges declared as the Labre
  conventions they always were.

- 7ec4478: Senior button components resolve their own label through the translation seam

  The toolbar's navigation tooltips learned to translate a senior tool's
  `labelKey`, but the seven framework senior-button components still carried
  their label as a hard-coded English string. Each button now resolves the same
  `com.labre.framework.<id>` key through `translateKey`, with the previous
  English wording as fallback — so a host catalogue that already translates the
  toolbar translates the buttons too, and a standalone playground reads exactly
  as before.

- a9eb4f6: Senior buttons name themselves in the user's language

  The edgeless toolbar's senior-tool tooltips were the last piece of chrome that
  could only say "Wardley map" or "Event Storming" — a raw English string carried
  on the tool itself, invisible to the host catalogue. A senior tool can now
  declare `labelKey` alongside its `name`, and the toolbar resolves it through
  the same `TranslationProvider` seam every other library wording already uses.

  The seven frameworks declare the key their descriptor already publishes
  (`com.labre.framework.<id>`), so a host that built its catalogue from
  `getTranslationKeyManifest()` translates the buttons with no new key to add.
  `name` stays required and stays the fallback: it is what a standalone
  playground shows, and it is all the core tools (note, shape, template…) have —
  they own no framework identity, so they declare no key.

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- b889326: feat(blocks): every key the library will ever ask for, on one list

  A host wiring `TranslationProvider` had no way to build its catalogue except
  chasing `translateKey` call sites and `labelKey` declarations across the repo
  — and no way to know a library upgrade had added one. This slice closes the
  seam from the other side: the library now says, out loud and exhaustively,
  which keys it can ask for.

  - **`getTranslationKeyManifest()`** (`@labre/affine/translations`) — the i18n
    sibling of `getShortcutManifest` / `getCommandManifest`: every
    `com.labre.*` key with its English fallback and its source
    (`command`, `role`, `rule`, `profile`, `nudge`, `audit-criterion`,
    `reading`, `background`, `framework`, `chrome`), enumerable without an
    editor instance and flag-independent, so one catalogue serves whatever a
    host later toggles on. Data-declared keys are WALKED from the same runtime
    declarations the editor registers — a key added to a rule or a command
    appears by construction. The widget chrome literals, which live in lit
    templates, are restated once; a unit test scans the library source and
    fails when a used key is missing from the manifest, when a manifest entry
    is used by nobody, or when a restated fallback drifts from what the widget
    renders.
  - **The manifest is COMPOSED, not centralised.** Each framework package
    exports its own contribution (`wardleyTranslationEntries`,
    `edgyTranslationEntries`, …) and the core manifest assembles the chrome's
    entries with the frameworks' — the same shape the command registry already
    has, and for the same reason: `@formicoidea/labre-core` is the editor minus
    the frameworks, so a manifest that named them from the core side would be
    complete in the monorepo and 107 keys of 175 short in the distribution hosts
    actually consume. `scripts/build-bundles.mjs` strips the groups from core's
    copy exactly as it strips the command groups, and a bundled host composes
    with `mergeTranslationEntries` (`@labre/std`, new).
  - The chrome wordings that sit behind template-literal keys (violation
    severities, exemption scopes, relation sides) are now EXPORTED tables the
    manifest walks rather than wordings restated a second time — which is what
    lets the drift check reach them.
  - The translation service grew the README the seam deserved
    (`packages/affine/shared/src/services/translation-service/README.md`):
    host wiring, fallback contract, how to bootstrap a catalogue from the
    manifest, how to compose it in the bundled distribution, and why the 22
    entries with no fallback must not be seeded into `en`. The service moved
    from `translation-service.ts` to `translation-service/index.ts` to house it
    — the barrel export is unchanged, no import moves.
