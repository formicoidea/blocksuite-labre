## 0.42.0

### Patch Changes

- 2e179bb: Colour pickers on the canvas page through the palettes of the active frameworks: the editor palette is always the first page, and the picker opens on the palette of the framework the selected element belongs to — its own role, else the ends of a connector, else the smallest framework board it sits on. A connector between two Wardley components, a label beside them or a frame drawn round the map can now be tinted with the framework's own hues instead of a hex typed from memory. Offering a palette is tooling: a framework switched off simply loses its page, and every colour already stored stays exactly as it was drawn.

### Minor Changes

- 75770e1: feat(blocks): every seed the DDD frameworks, the generic diagrams and the gfx-primitive packages write into a document at creation now resolves through the translation seam (`translateKey`, ADR 0016), so a document created in a translated host starts in that language instead of English — a document created before these keys existed keeps its plain text.

  Event Storming's eight sticky captions and its hotspot; Core Domain's five sub-domain dots and three Team Topologies markers (both palettes derived from tables shared in `ddd-shared`, exported once as `dddSharedTranslationEntries` and spread into each consuming framework rather than restated); Context Map's bounded-context bubble and its cloud's "System" name; Cynefin/Estuarine's two hand-composed compositions ("Decision sorting"'s four domain stickies, "Constraint map"'s three hexagon captions); the standalone "Aggregate Design Canvas" template's header and nine section titles; the five generic ("Other") templates — SWOT's four quadrant labels, Kanban's card/column words, the Business Model Canvas's title and nine section names, Fishbone's category/effect/item words, Gantt's phase names and its `{{n}}`-parameterised week header; a frame's and a group's default title (`Frame {{n}}` / `Group {{n}}`); the "/ Mind Map" slash command's and the drag-from-basket mindmap tool's root and child captions; the four starter mindmap templates' root and three topic captions; and an imported `.mm`/`.opml` file's untitled-node fallback.

  Every hand-composed template touched (the mindmap starters, the two Cynefin/Estuarine compositions, the Aggregate Design Canvas, the five generic diagrams) gained a `localize` rebuild mirroring the derived-template mechanism already in place: without a host catalogue every one of them still inserts byte-identical English content. Non-framework packages that write seeds now have their own small `translations.ts`, listed under a new `PACKAGE_SEED_WORDINGS` table in the manifest (source `seed`, alongside the existing chrome-sourced `PACKAGE_WORDINGS`) — the same minimal extension the seed-source manifest already needed for a framework's own seeds.

  Left untouched, and why: the DDD Context Map's nine relationship patterns write no seed at all since WS2 (the palette arms the connector tool rather than dropping a labelled group — nothing to translate); the mindmap model's own "New node" default (a red zone — `packages/affine/model`) and the two callers that rely on it sit in packages outside this lot's scope; the code and shared-adapter "Plain Text"/"Untitled" fallbacks run in the paste/import pipeline's `Transformer`, whose optional `provider` is never wired to the editor's `TranslationProvider` by any existing caller.

- 5744cfd: feat(blocks): the AFFiNE chrome of media, documents, embeds and frames now resolves through the translation seam instead of raw English literals. Attachment's and image's slash-menu items, toolbars (Replace, Turn into card view, Download/Upload toasts with the file name or a formatted size) and error messages; bookmark's, embed-doc's and embed's slash-menu items, card-style switchers, "Open doc"/"Open this doc" toolbars, iframe error/idle/invalid-URL/link-popup cards and the HTML embed's empty state; surface-ref's slash-menu items (mind map, frame, group, including the live "Frame: {{title}}"/"Group: {{title}}" list entries, previously built by string concatenation) and its per-kind placeholder cards (deleted / cannot-display, one full sentence per reference kind); frame's dense-menu, surface toolbar, presentation mode (previous/next, fullscreen, frame order, reached-first/last) and the frame panel's header and settings menu — all now carry keys, resolved via `translateKey`/`labelWording`/`tooltipWording`/`nameWording`/`descriptionWording`/`captionWording`. Words shared across two or more of these packages (Caption, Download, Reload, Rename, Frame, Settings, Loading…, Untitled, the four card-style labels…) moved to `@labre/affine-shared/services`'s `chrome.ts` as single shared keys rather than being restated per package. Every non-framework package touched gained its own `./translations` export subpath, imported by `packages/affine/all/src/translations.ts`. With no catalogue registered every surface reads exactly as it did before — no visible change for a host that has not wired a `TranslationService`.

  Left untouched, and why: the surface-ref preview-tooltip illustrations (`configs/tooltips.ts`) keep their English figures per an earlier PO decision; displayed domains/URLs are unchanged per PO decision; the three linked-doc export adapters' (`embed-doc/src/embed-linked-doc-block/adapters/{html,markdown,plain-text}.ts`) own "untitled" fallback stays a plain literal — per the L2b lot's precedent, the paste/import pipeline's `Transformer` carries an optional `provider` never wired to the editor's `TranslationProvider` by any existing caller, so resolving a key there would be dead code rather than a real translation path; the `embed-youtube-block`, `embed-loom-block`, `embed-figma-block` and `embed-github-block` directories are out of scope (postponed embeds).

### Patch Changes

- a513f05: Displayed English now says "Canvas" where it said "Edgeless" and "Document" where "Page" named the document mode (display-mode options, note and frame toolbars, toasts, slash-menu group headers, surface-ref placeholders, the frame and mind-map slash-menu previews). Translation keys, identifiers and stored values are unchanged. Three keys that already shipped change their English fallback: `com.labre.embed.synced-doc.empty-preview`, `com.labre.toast.frame-inserted-into-page` and `com.labre.toast.note-removed-from-page-mode`. The mobile keyboard toolbar is left as is.
- b2781b5: refactor(blocks): one chrome word, one key. Where several packages declared the same English interface word under different keys (Copy-style verbs, text formats, display modes, Reload, Rename, Settings…), they now share one wording from `@labre/affine-shared/services`, and the key manifest carries 52 fewer entries. Nothing changes on screen, and no key that existed in a previous release is removed: the merged keys were all introduced by this release's translation work. The manifest spec now fails when a new interface word is declared under a second key (real homonyms such as « Light » or « Left » are allow-listed with a reason).

  write — or throw — on remote polygon moves, connector mode changes, block adds
  above a frame, or mindmap children rewrites. Connector label and mindmap node
  view lookups are null-safe.

## 0.38.0

### Patch Changes

- 206b5a1: fix(edgeless): a framework background never covers what is drawn on it

  - A board, map or pool created AFTER the elements it surrounds now lands under them instead of hiding them.
  - Anything dropped onto a board that sits above it is raised just above that board, and still below the board's own artefacts.
  - Superposed boards stack in the order they were placed, each under its own artefacts — a cross-reading is now possible.
  - One rule for every framework: EDGY, Wardley, C4, BPMN, Cynefin, Estuarine and the DDD boards all answer the same way.

- b202320: fix(edgeless): a frame drawn on a framework board stays visible above it

  A frame is deliberately sent to the back of the stack so it renders behind its
  own content — but a Wardley map, a C4 board or a BPMN pool is an opaque canvas
  element, so the frame went behind the board and only the strip overhanging it
  stayed visible. A frame now lands just above the topmost board it covers
  (still behind everything the frame owns), whether it is drawn there or dragged
  onto it afterwards.

## 0.34.0

### Patch Changes

- 8b00f7d: fix(blocks): core toasts, board tooltips, catalogue headers and seed texts cross the translation seam

  A host that wires `TranslationExtension` now gets a catalogue that covers the
  editor, instead of one that covers everything except the parts a user actually
  reads first. Six families of hard-coded English are gone (refs #182, #183);
  every one of them is a `com.labre.*` key with the previous literal as its
  English fallback, so an editor with no `TranslationProvider` registered reads
  exactly what it read before.

  - **Toasts** — "Copied to clipboard", "Linked doc created", "Note removed from
    Page Mode", "Frame inserted into Page.", "No link found".
  - **Board toolbars** — the resize toggle every framework board carries, and the
    two legend wordings, declared once in `@labre/affine-shared` rather than
    eight times.
  - **Editor chrome** — the toolbar verbs (Copy, Duplicate, Delete, Lock, Link,
    More, Bring to Front, Send to Back, Create linked doc, Draw connector), the
    view switcher (Switch / Inline / Card / Embed view) and the linked-doc card's
    four "nothing to show" sentences. `ToolbarAction` gained `labelWording` /
    `tooltipWording`: a declared `[key, English]` pair the toolbar resolves when
    it builds the row, which keeps a call site one line and keeps the row's width
    planning honest about what it is about to say.
  - **Catalogue headers** — every framework now contributes its own
    `com.labre.catalogue.category.*` keys. Core's registry names no framework
    category once `build:bundles` has stripped it, so a bundled host was drawing
    translated entries under English headers.
  - **BPMN import remarks** — the three whose wording is a fixed sentence carry a
    key (`InterchangeNote.messageKey`). The ones that name an element, an id or a
    count of lanes do not: the seam has no interpolation.
  - **Seed texts** — the caption a placed BPMN or EDGY artefact is given, and a
    C4 board's name, are resolved AT PLACEMENT. What lands in the document is
    content the author owns from that moment on and is never re-translated.

  `getTranslationKeyManifest()` gains all of it, including a new `'seed'` source
  for the words a framework writes onto the canvas.

  Three surfaces are deliberately left English, and each one is a refusal rather
  than an oversight. The **C4 component tier seeds** (`NODE_LABEL`,
  `C4_TYPE_PLACEHOLDER`, `DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER`) are read back as SENTINELS by
  the morph and by the mermaid exporter, which is a pure function of the board
  and has no `std` to re-resolve them with — translating them would change what
  an export writes. The **code block's "⋮"** is a `MenuItemGroup` rendered over a
  generic context that carries no `std`. The **slash menu** and the **mobile
  keyboard toolbar** item names are their own vocabularies, untouched apart from
  the toasts they raise.

### Patch Changes

- dc5261e: fix(edgeless): keep frames raisable above wardley map backgrounds

  A frame drawn on top of a large canvas backdrop (such as a Wardley map
  background) could be auto-adopted as that backdrop's owner in reverse: the
  backdrop's center fell inside the frame, so the frame swallowed the backdrop
  as a child. Because a frame always renders behind everything it owns and
  "bring to front" only reorders top-level siblings, the frame became buried
  behind its own background with no way to raise it. A frame now refuses to
  auto-adopt any element that fully encloses it — and refuses a framework
  background outright, whatever its geometry: a frame taller than the map
  would slip through the geometric test, and since the background primitive
  the model says directly what the geometry only hinted at.

### Patch Changes

- 4aeb85e: Fix new elements created inside a frame randomly rendering behind existing
  frame children: the auto-adopted element now gets an index strictly above its
  new siblings, so a freshly created shape always lands on top — matching the
  behavior outside frames.
